# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jlargs64
- I've been at IBM since 2020 starting from an intern all the way to architect.
- Now, I'm back in my roots of IBM Z working on z/OS as a QA Developer
- I enjoy applying data structures and algorithms to intriguing problems, like building custom web crawlers for use with generative AI.
- I'm currently learning Golang but frequently like to check out what's new in different areas of tech.
